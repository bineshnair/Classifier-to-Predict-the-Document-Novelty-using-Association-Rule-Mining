# Classifier-to-Predict-the-Document-Novelty-using-Association-Rule-Mining
As part of my summer project, I have taken up a novel idea of developing a classifier to predict the novelty (in terms of uniqueness of content) of an unread document using the technique of association rule mining.  Lack of novelty in most of the relevant documents concerns analysts who have to read and analyze many articles daily. The proposed model is an un-supervised classifier which predicts a documentâ€™s novelty using the association rule mining technique. A list of domain specific keywords is identified and the classifier is trained on a set of training documents to identify the strongly associated terms with these domain specific keywords. This set of strongly associated terms represent the corpus which is then used to determine the novelty of a future unseen document (or a test document). The framework uses a novelty threshold to effectively classify the novelty of a future document. Training and test dataset is a set of un-tagged documents (in the medicine domain) from the popular Newsgroups20 dataset. The result of the classifier is compared with the manual tagging done by matured human assessors. Popular metrics in the classification tasks like, precision, recall, F-score, specificity and accuracy have been used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Results indicate that the classifier has performed reasonably well given the fact that every document has always some new content.
